# Example of how to use tarpc with iroh

Simple example of how to use an RPC protocol for rust project over iroh. 

[iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) - peer-2-peer that just works from n0-computer
[tarpc](https://github.com/google/tarpc) - Unofficial RPC for Rust from Google

In a real project the client, server and tarpc::service would be put in separate files
